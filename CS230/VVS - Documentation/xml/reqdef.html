>1.1. Purpose</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;      To give a detailed description of the Vorpal Voting System to include all functions and requirements specified by Morgantown University and its representatives. These representatives include the University Provost, student groups and their advisor, the student body representative(s), Admissions and Records, and the Office of Information Technology (OIT). This document is also intended to give a clear and concise summary of all communication between Vorpal Longsword +1 (known herein as the developer) and all Morgantown University Representatives (known herein as the stakeholders) which pertains to the required functions and uses of the Vorpal Voting System.

></H2
><P
>&#13;The stakeholders have determined they require all elections and polls that apply to the student body to be handled and maintained through an interactive online system. The developer has created the Vorpal Voting System (VVS) as a solution to this software need. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;     The VVS will allow university student groups to create and manage their own elections and polls online. The VVS will also allow all eligible students to vote in elections and polls online. Students will be able to access the VVS through their University’s Web Portal that is already in place. All results and statistical data resulting from elections and polls will be maintained by the VVS for 7 years. The VVS will interface directly with Admissions and Records databases to create its own database of all eligible student voters which, once created, will be accessible independent of the Admission and Records databases. Finally, the VVS will conform to all general election standards unless otherwise specified within. The VVS will be used strictly for election and polling purposes only. The VVS will not be used in any manner which provides support or facilitates election campaigning. It will also not be used to host elections that only apply to University faculty or administrators.
    </P
><P
>&#13;Once the VVS is installed and operational it will drastically improve the timeliness and efficiency of student oriented elections and polls. The system should encourage and increase voter participation by making it easier for students to vote. Students will be able to vote from any computer with an internet connection. Results will be available immediately following the close of any election and statistical data will be available for use by the stakeholders. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;It is the goal of the developer to create a system that has a user friendly interface and meets all of the requirements and functionality requested by the stakeholders.

The document will be used by both the developer and stakeholders to ensure that the needs of the stakeholder are being met while the VVS is under development. Hardware and interfaces with other systems will be explained. The methods and procedures the developer will use to produce the VVS will be discussed in detail. All functions of the system will be listed with a brief explanation. Detailed explanation of functionality will be discussed in future documentation. A description of possible users and their level of technical proficiency as relating to the use of the system will be covered. Constraints of the system will be discussed and finally a brief risk assessment and evaluation of assumptions and dependencies will be included.

>&#13;      The Vorpal Voting System will serve as a polling system to be
      utilized by students of MU. The VVS will integrate with the
      current web based infrastructure maintained by Morgantown
      University.  That being said, VVS will be available via the
      world wide web through the already existing Morgantown
      University web portal.  Students of MU will log into the VVS
      using their credentials assigned by from the university, which
      are on record with the campus admission and records office.
      While the VVS will incorporate with the campus web portal, it
      will be hosted externally on Vorpal Longsword servers and will
      communicate with campus IT to authenticate or verify the status
      of users.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The system will be modular enough to house any type of poll;
      Examples include student government elections to campus cafe
      evaluation.  Dynamically, administrators of the system will be
      able to create polls which include an array of options.  Once
      the polls have taken place, statistical results will be sent to
      users and detailed statistics will be available to certain
      users.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The basis of the system lies in the roles of users which will be
      provided by the system.  This includes the actual student users
      (SV's), student organization and government officials (PA's),
      faculty advisors / university provost (VVSA's).  Certain
      privileges will are provided depending on the user in question.
      The privileges are detailed in the diagrams included in this
      section.  It is assumed that the privileges available to the SV
      are available to the PA, which are in turn available to the VVSA
      with slight variation.
