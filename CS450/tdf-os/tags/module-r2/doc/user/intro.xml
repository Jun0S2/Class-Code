    <title>About MPX</title>
    <para>
      The MPX Operating System, which is shorthand for
      MultiProgramming eXecutive, is a project that was created by
      Malcolm Lane and James Mooney and published in the Project
      Manual of <citetitle type="Book">A Practical Approach to
      Operating Systems</citetitle>.
    </para>
    <para>
      MPX is programmed using C, and is designed to simulate low-level
      functionality, though it will use an underlying MS-DOS
      installation for hardware abstraction. MPX operates exclusively
      in the command-line interface, and all commands and operations
      will have to be called by a shell.

    <title>About the Command Handler</title>
    <para>
      The command handler is the first interactive piece of TDF which
      you as a user will come into contact with. You can recognize
      when you have reached the command handler by the welcome message
      showing the current version appearing at the top of your
      screen. Below the welcome message will be the command prompt
      waiting for input. What you see will look similar to following.
