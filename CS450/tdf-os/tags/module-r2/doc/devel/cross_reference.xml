    The purpose of this chapter is to outline how the functions work together
    in unison to produce the grand final results.

  <section id="The Shell">
    SHELL.C serves as the central hub for the program. It calls the following:
    PCBDLL_creation, parse_buffer, and every single command that is
    accessible to the user (date, version, history, help, pcreate, pdelete,
    pblock, punblock, psuspend, presume, psetprio, pshowall, pshow, 
    pshowblk, pshowrd). The shell is called by main in TDF.C. The
    exit command is handled internally by the shell.

  <section id="PCBs">
  <para>
    There are 11 pcb commands in all, and each one pulls various functions
    from PCB.C, which handles the internal operations of the PCBs and the
    PCBDLLs. The internal functions rarely call other internal functions
    with a few exceptions: PCB_setup calls PCB_find to make sure the
    given name is unique, and PCBDLL_creation calls PCBDLL_alloc to allocate
    memory. PCB_setup also calls PCB_alloc to allocate memory.
