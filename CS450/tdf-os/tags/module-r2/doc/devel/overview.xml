    TDF-OS is an MPX operating system designed by the Tours de force team
    in Spring 2009 for the CS 450 Operating Systems course at West Virginia

    Presently, the operating system consists of two components: the shell
    of the operating system and the process control blocks, as well as their
    container queues that are associated with them. As the project
    progresses, other features such as an interupt handler will be implemented
    into the operating system, and it will run on a serial port emulator.

    The developer's manual is designed to document the source of the project
    such that any new developer can read the documentation and be
    thoroughly informed of how the project is mapped out.
