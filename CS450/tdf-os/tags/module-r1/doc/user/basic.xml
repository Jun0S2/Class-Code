  <para>
    It is very plain to see that, when initiated, the TDF operating system
    displays only a command prompt. As there is graphical interface
    bundled with the operating system, this will be the only way in which
    commands may be input to the system for processing.
  </para>

  <para>
    Inputting commands to be processed is very simple. The following prompt
    (or something very similar) should be initially displayed on the
    screen:
    <programlisting>
      tdf:$ 
    </programlisting>
    At this prompt, you may simply type in the desired command to be
    processed (for information about the various commands offered in
    the TDF operating system, simply type "help" or refer to the
    "Commands" chapter of this manual). To terminate the system, simply
    type "exit" at the prompt.
  </para>

  <para>
    The commands typed into the prompt have certain restrictions as far as
    formatting goes. For example, all of the commands are case sensitive and
    must be typed in all lower-case (for example, you cannot process
    "EXIT", but you may process "exit"). Another restriction is that the
    commands may not exceed 256 characters in length (not that you'll ever
    need that much buffer space).
  </para>

  <para>
    Some commands implemented in the TDF operating system have arguments
    that may be passed, such that they will perform more specific processes
    (for example, date). To pass arguments to these commands, you must
    specify the flag and, if applicable, the value of the argument. For
    example, to set the date, the following command may be run:
    <programlisting>
      tdf:$ date -s 2009
    </programlisting>
