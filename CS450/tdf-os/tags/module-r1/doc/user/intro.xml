    <para>
      The MPX Operating System, which is shorthand for MultiProgramming 
      eXecutive, is a project that was created by Malcolm Lane and James
      Mooney and published in the Project Manual of 
      <u>A Practical Approach to Operating Systems</u>.

    <para>
      MPX is programmed using C, and is designed to simulate low-level 
      functionality, though it will use an underlying MS-DOS installation 
      for hardware abstraction. MPX operates exclusively in the 
      command-line interface, and all commands and operations will have
      to be called by a shell.
