    This chapter will outline the data structures that have been created for
    the project.

    <para>
      <indexterm><primary>PCB</primary></indexterm>
      The PCB structure contains the following values:
      <programlisting>
        char name[8] - the name of the process (8 characters or less)
        int pclass - the class of the process (APPLICATION or SYSTEM)
        int priority - the priority of the process (between -127 and 128)
        int state - the state of the process (which queue it's in)
        unsigned char pstack[1024] - the memory stack of the PCB
        int memsize - the size of the memory space
        unsigned char *loadaddr - the load address of the memory
        unsigned char *execaddr - the executing address of the memory
      </programlisting>

    <title>struct PCBDLL</title>
    <para>
      <indexterm><primary>PCBDLL</primary></indexterm>
      The PCBDLL structure is a doubly linked list with a dummy header
      node. Each PCBDLL is essentially an individual node of the linked
      list with pointers to the previous and next nodes. The PCBDLL
      structure contains the following values:
      <programlisting>
        struct PCBDLL *prev - the previous element in the list
        struct PCBDLL *next - the next element in the list
        PCB *contents - the PCB contents of the current node
      </programlisting>
