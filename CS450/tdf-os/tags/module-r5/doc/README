Documentation Gets Compiled in here


With the correct settings we should have a much better time parsing
and translating our documents.

On Fedora Core 10 these two statements will compile the HTML version
of the user and developer documentation from the root directory.

xsltproc --xinclude -o doc/html/user.xhtml /usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-ns-stylesheets-1.74.0/xhtml/docbook.xsl doc/user/user.xml 
xsltproc --xinclude -o doc/html/devel.xhtml /usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-ns-stylesheets-1.74.0/xhtml/docbook.xsl doc/devel/devel.xml
