GENIC (num-centers, num-initial-points, generation-size)

 (1)
 c = individual center
 m = number of initial points
 n = generation size
 k = number of centers  (Fixed at 10 in GENIC2, always less than m.)

 (2)
 Select num-initial-points (m) for initial candidate centers.
 Give each one a weight of 1.

 (3)
 For each data point P in the generation:

   Increment count by 1.
   Find the nearest center (C) to the point (P).
     Sum the euclidian distances of the columns: sqrt(val1 - val2)^2 or 1/0
     Move the center:
       Column = (Weight * Old-Value + P's-Value) / (Weight + 1)
     Increment that center's weight by 1.

 (4)
 When generation has been processed, loop over the centers:

   Calculate it's probability of survival: CenterWeight / AllClusterWeights
   Generate a number between [0,1], if that center's probability of survival
     is greater than that number, retain it for the next round.
     If it is less, kill it, replace it with a random point.
   Set center's weight back to 1.

 (GENIC2)
 Kill off any centers that are less than maxWeight/2.
 If you didn't kill any clusters, increase K by 50%.

 Progress to the next generation.

 (5)
 Group the (M) centers into a final list of (K) centers based on distance.
