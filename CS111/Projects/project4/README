(1) Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------
	As you can see there's a lot of files in this package.
You only need to compile and run two of them. If you want to 
run the command line version of this program then do this:

$ javac CruiseShipManagerCLI.java
$ java CruiseShipManager

Using this verson you may notice that when you run some commands
they don't seem to do anything -- just scroll up. The menu system
reprints itself each time you run a command so it tends to cover
up anything that got output.

If you want to run the Graphical version of this program 
then do this:

$ javac CruiseShipManagerGUI.java
$ java CruiseShipManagerGUI

I recommend the Graphical version. I spent a lot of time on that :D



(2) Special Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------
	This is a reallllllly complex program. I'm also bored 
right now so I'm going to explain the structure of this program.
This is the basic flow.
